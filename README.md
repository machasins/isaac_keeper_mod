This mod simply plays a vine boom sound and the narrartor saying 'Balls' whenever Isaac encounters "Keeper's Sack".

Can be configured with [Mod Config Menu](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2681875787) to adjust when the sound plays and how loud it is.

Thanks to [Lazy Mattman](https://www.youtube.com/@lazymattman) for inspiration and [BluePipe](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2491837386) for sound effects.
